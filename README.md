# Mapping Earthquakes

The objective of this project is to map out recent earthquakes and add lables with the name of the location where the earthquake took place and its magnitude using Leaflet.js. Using different layers and colors, the map shows tectonic plates and each point is given a color depending on the intensity of the earquake, with a guide on the bottom right corner of the map for better understanding.

Users can also change the map type from having a satellite, street, light, or dark view. The map can also show three different layers (Earthquakes, Tectonic Plates, and Major Earthquakes) by themselves or all together.
